Contributions to help.aetherlog.com are most welcome! The content for the site is open source precisely so that regular Aether users are able to contribute to it by reporting and fixing mistakes, asking questions, and even adding content. My time to work on Aether is limited, so help with improving this site means more time to develop new features for Aether itself.

There are a few guidelines to follow to make it easier to integrate your contributions.

## Use Github Issues and Pull Requests

If you'd like to add the new content, or fix a mistake yourself, please open a pull request
rather than opening an issue.

If you'd just like to ask a question, or report a mistake without fixing it yourself, please open an issue after checking
to be sure there's not already an existing open issue.

Contributions must be submitted using Github. Contributions sent as code dumps via email
are difficult to merge in, don't promote discussion and iteration, and don't leave a 
good "paper trail" explaining the change. If you're new to contributing via GitHub, feel free to [email me](mailto:andrew@aetherlog.com) and I'll be happy to help you get started.

## Style Note

The writing style of help.aetherlog.com should be clear, detailed, and approachable even for begging or novice computer users. Step by step instructions, and good screenshots are used extensively. If you add documentation to the site, please try to match the existing style closely.

**Thanks!**
