## Overview

This page lists the rigs that Aether officially supports for rig control. For rigs not on this list, rig control _may_ still work by selecting a similar rig from the same manufacturer. If you'd like to see support for a rig that is not currently supported, please [contact](https://www.aetherlog.com/contact.html) Aether support.

## Support For New Rigs

I rely on Aether users to test support for rigs that I don't own. I will only add official support for a rig after having someone confirm that it works with Aether. Most new radios use the same or a very similar CAT protocol as other radios made recently by the same manufacturer. If your radio isn't on this list, please try selecting a similar radio in Aether's Rig Control settings. Whether or not it works, please [email Aether support](mailto:support@aetherlog.com) to tell me that which rig you're using, and which rig settings work with it so I can add official support for it to Aether.

Note that many modern Yaesu radios use Kenwood's CAT protocol, so for new Yaesu radios, it makes sense to try a Kenwood setting (e.g. TS-2000).
